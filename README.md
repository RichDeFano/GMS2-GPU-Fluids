# GMS2-GPU-Fluids
An application of the discretized Navier-Stokes equations for 2D incompressible fluids, optimized with the help of the GPU.
HEAVY WIP - Only started a few days ago, not in usable condition yet.
  end goals include modeling and automatic generation of liquids and gasses for pixel level animations(eg water, fire, smoke, viscous liquids)
Various other simulations and papers were used as reference.
